-when you load the app, it should get user information from the frontend
    -user logs into front end...that info is passed to the backend and looked up in the database
    -the backend finds the user in the database and passes back a token, which can be used by subsequent requests 

-with the user info, it should then look up all associated habits with that user
-when the app loads, habits from the backend should be sent to the frontend
    -will need to add some sort of user validation
