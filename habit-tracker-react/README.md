## Purpose

Habit maker is a productivity tool, designed to help users build new habits.

## Usage

Users select a habit name, a time period, and an amount of days within that timeframe that they want to perform this habit. For example, you might want to build up a habit of keeping your room clean, so you could set a timeframe of 30 days and a goal of cleaning your room 15 days out of those 30.

## Future Updates

- **v1.1.0**

  - option to restart a particular habit after the time period runs out

- **v1.2.0**
  - collect statistics for users so they can see what habits they accomplished or failed at and maybe give an overall percentage of completed habits
